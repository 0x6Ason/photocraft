# Development guide

## Prerequisites

- Rust stable (1.90+). Add the web target with `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
- macOS, Windows or Linux. Linux needs `libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libgtk-3-dev`.

## Build and run

```sh
cargo run --release -p photocraft -- path/to/image.psd      # desktop app
cargo run --release -p photocraft -- --control 7878 img.jpg # with the JSON control server
cargo test --workspace                                     # everything
cargo xtask ci                                             # fmt + clippy + tests + layers + wasm
cargo xtask stats                                          # tests and lines per crate
```

Image code is slow at `opt-level 0`, so the workspace profile builds dependencies at `opt-level 2`. Use `--release` for anything interactive.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `PHOTOCRAFT_CONTROL_PORT` | Same as `--control <port>` |
| `PHOTOCRAFT_CPU_CANVAS=1` | Force the CPU canvas path instead of the wgpu shader canvas |
| `PHOTOCRAFT_GPU_TILE=2048` | Force GPU canvas tiling (tests tile seams) |
| `PHOTOCRAFT_THEME_FILE=tokens.json` | **Debug builds only:** live design-token overrides, re-read on change |

### Live design tokens

```json
{ "card": "#323232", "tab_strip": "#262626", "accent": "#378ef0", "radius": 4 }
```

Keys are the field names of `theme::Tokens` (`crates/ui-egui/src/theme.rs`). Edit and save the file while the app runs to see changes immediately, with no recompile. This is compiled out of release builds.

## Driving the app programmatically

Start the app with `--control 7878`. It then accepts JSON lines on `127.0.0.1:7878`:

```sh
printf '%s\n' '{"id":1,"method":"engine.execute","params":{"command":"layer.newAdjustmentLayer.hueSaturation","params":{"hue":30}}}' \
              '{"id":2,"method":"ui.screenshot","params":{"path":"/tmp/shot.png"}}' | nc 127.0.0.1 7878
```

See `docs/control-protocol.md` for every method. Tips:

- **macOS does not render occluded windows.** `ui.screenshot` raises the window first (`focus: true` by default). Use `ui.focus` before other visual checks.
- **Capture only our own window.** For native captures (to see the real title bar and traffic lights), capture by window id (`screencapture -l <CGWindowID>`), never a screen region, which can grab other apps.
- **Pointer gestures:** `ui.pointer` takes events in *document* coordinates and runs them through the same tool state machine as the mouse.

## Testing strategy

- **Unit and property tests** in every crate. proptest is used for tile COW, regions and codecs.
- **Format crates:**
  - synthetic generators (`psd::testgen`)
  - byte-exact round trips
  - malformed-input sweeps (truncate at every offset)
  - fuzz targets (`crates/*/fuzz`)
- **Real-file corpus** in `corpus/` (gitignored). `corpus/psd` holds MIT-licensed test PSDs, listed with their sources in `corpus/psd/SOURCES.md`, and `cargo xtask corpus --download` fetches PngSuite. Tests skip silently when a corpus is absent.
- **Composite oracle:** a PSD's embedded merged image is compared with our compositor's output. The pass rate is tracked in the roadmap.
- **UI:** unit tests for widgets and state, plus screenshot checks through the control channel.

## Performance notes

- The canvas is presented by a custom WGSL shader (`ui-egui/src/gpu_canvas.rs`): mip-mapped/nearest sampling, procedural checkerboard, pixel grid, tiling. Brush strokes upload only their damage rect.
- **Compositing is still CPU** (`photocraft-compose`). Live adjustment previews on large documents use a downsampled proxy (`ui-egui/src/proxy.rs`). The GPU compositor is milestone M5.
- `ui.inspect` returns `perf` timings (UI ms per frame, composite ms, upload ms).
- Never scan full surfaces per frame. Cache per document revision (`PhotocraftApp::cached_bounds`). An uncached `content_bounds()` on a 36 MP layer once cost 77 ms per frame.

## Web build

`apps/photocraft-web` runs the same `PhotocraftApp` in the browser through eframe's web runner. The renderer is wgpu: WebGPU where the browser has it, WebGL2 otherwise. It is Rust only. The only JavaScript is the glue that wasm-bindgen generates.

```sh
brew install trunk                 # or: cargo install trunk --locked
cd apps/photocraft-web
trunk build --release              # writes ../../dist/web (index.html, .js glue, .wasm)
trunk serve --release              # dev server on http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

Any static file server works for `dist/web`, for example `python3 -m http.server 8765` run inside that directory. Trunk downloads the matching `wasm-bindgen` and `wasm-opt` itself. The release `.wasm` is about 12.7 MB, or 5.0 MB gzipped. Serve it with compression.

URL flags: `?webgl` forces the WebGL2 backend, and `?cpu` forces the CPU canvas path.

How the web shell (`apps/photocraft-web/src/web.rs`) differs from desktop:

- **Open** uses `rfd::AsyncFileDialog`. The bytes arrive asynchronously in `Services::inbox`, which the app drains every frame.
- **Save / Save As / Export** trigger a browser download of the encoded bytes. The shell does this with a Blob, an object URL and a temporary `<a download>`, all created from Rust. There is no save dialog, so the suggested name becomes the download name.
- **Drag-and-drop:** `WebShell` takes the frame's `dropped_files` before the app sees them. It reads each file with `DroppedFile::bytes_async` and pushes the bytes into the inbox.
- **No control server:** browsers can't listen on TCP. To automate the web build, drive headless Chrome with `--remote-debugging-port`. `Page.setInterceptFileChooserDialog` plus `DOM.setFileInputFiles` covers Open, `Input.dispatchDragEvent` with `files` covers drops, and `Browser.setDownloadBehavior` captures downloads.
- Headless Chrome on macOS (`--headless=new --enable-unsafe-webgpu`) gets a real WebGPU adapter.
