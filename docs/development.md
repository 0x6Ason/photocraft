# Development guide

## Prerequisites

- Rust stable (1.90+). Add the web target with `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
- macOS, Windows or Linux. Linux needs `libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libgtk-3-dev`.

## Build and run

```sh
cargo run --release -p photocraft -- path/to/image.psd      # desktop app
cargo run --release -p photocraft -- --control 7878 img.jpg # with the JSON control server
cargo test --workspace                                     # everything
cargo xtask ci                                             # fmt + clippy + tests + layers + wasm
cargo xtask stats                                          # tests and lines per crate
```

Image code is slow at `opt-level 0`, so the workspace profile builds dependencies at `opt-level 2`. Use `--release` for anything interactive.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `PHOTOCRAFT_CONTROL_PORT` | Same as `--control <port>` |
| `PHOTOCRAFT_CPU_CANVAS=1` | Force the CPU canvas path instead of the wgpu shader canvas |
| `PHOTOCRAFT_GPU_TILE=2048` | Force GPU canvas tiling (tests tile seams) |
| `PHOTOCRAFT_THEME_FILE=tokens.json` | **Debug builds only:** live design-token overrides, re-read on change |

### Live design tokens

```json
{ "card": "#323232", "tab_strip": "#262626", "accent": "#378ef0", "radius": 4 }
```

Keys are the field names of `theme::Tokens` (`crates/ui-egui/src/theme.rs`). Edit and save the file while the app runs to see changes immediately, with no recompile. This is compiled out of release builds.

## Driving the app programmatically

Start the app with `--control 7878`. It then accepts JSON lines on `127.0.0.1:7878`:

```sh
printf '%s\n' '{"id":1,"method":"engine.execute","params":{"command":"layer.newAdjustmentLayer.hueSaturation","params":{"hue":30}}}' \
              '{"id":2,"method":"ui.screenshot","params":{"path":"/tmp/shot.png"}}' | nc 127.0.0.1 7878
```

See `docs/control-protocol.md` for every method. Tips:

- **macOS does not render occluded windows.** `ui.screenshot` raises the window first (`focus: true` by default). Use `ui.focus` before other visual checks.
- **Capture only our own window.** For native captures (to see the real title bar and traffic lights), capture by window id (`screencapture -l <CGWindowID>`), never a screen region, which can grab other apps.
- **Pointer gestures:** `ui.pointer` takes events in *document* coordinates and runs them through the same tool state machine as the mouse.

## Headless CLI

`apps/photocraft-cli` builds the binary `photocraft-cli`:

```sh
cargo run -p photocraft-cli -- convert in.psd out.pcraft               # any supported format -> any
cargo run -p photocraft-cli -- info out.pcraft                          # JSON: size, mode, depth, layer tree
cargo run -p photocraft-cli -- run in.png --cmd layer.new.layer --params '{"name":"Ink"}' \
                                          --cmd filter.blur.gaussian --params '{"radius":3}' --out out.psd
cargo run -p photocraft-cli -- run --new '{"width":800,"height":600}' --cmd document.inspect
cargo run -p photocraft-cli -- batch --actions actions.json --in photos/ --out done/ --format jpg
cargo run -p photocraft-cli -- commands --filter blur                    # the command registry
```

`actions.json` is `[{"command": "<id>", "params": {…}}, …]`, which is the same shape as a recorded action. `run` prints one JSON line per command result.

## Native format (.pcraft)

`crates/format` defines the lossless native bundle. It is either a ZIP of STORE entries or a directory with the same layout:

- `manifest.json`: the versioned document tree, with migrations in `format/src/migrate.rs`.
- `tiles/<blake3>.zst` and `blobs/<blake3>.zst`: zstd-compressed objects, content-addressed by the BLAKE3 hash of their uncompressed bytes.
- `thumb.png` and `composite/preview.png`: previews.

Keep one `PcraftWriter` per open document: re-saving then only compresses and writes tiles that changed, and directory bundles garbage-collect unreferenced objects. `format::Autosaver` writes snapshots into a recovery directory on a background thread. `list_recovery` / `recover` / `discard_recovery` implement crash recovery.

`photocraft-io` routes `.pcraft` through this crate in `import`/`export`, detecting it by magic or by extension.

## MCP (agents)

`photocraft-cli mcp` serves MCP on stdio using `crates/automation`, which is built on `rmcp`:

- **Headless:** `photocraft-cli mcp`. It drives an in-process engine session.
- **Live app:** start `photocraft --control 7878`, then run `photocraft-cli mcp --bridge 127.0.0.1:7878`. See `docs/control-protocol.md#mcp-bridge`.

Tools:

- `session_list`
- `doc_open`, `doc_new`, `doc_save`, `doc_export`, `doc_inspect`, `doc_render_preview` (returns a PNG image), `doc_select`, `doc_close`
- `command_list`, `command_run`
- bridge only: `ui_inspect`, `ui_screenshot`, `ui_pointer`, `ui_menu_invoke`, `ui_set`, `control_call`

Claude Code (`.mcp.json` in the repo root, or `claude mcp add`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "photocraft": {
      "command": "/path/to/photocraft/target/release/photocraft-cli",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    },
    "photocraft-live": {
      "command": "/path/to/photocraft/target/release/photocraft-cli",
      "args": ["mcp", "--bridge", "127.0.0.1:7878"]
    }
  }
}
```

```sh
cargo build --release -p photocraft-cli
claude mcp add photocraft -- "$PWD/target/release/photocraft-cli" mcp
```

A typical agent loop:

1. `doc_open {path}`
2. `command_list {filter:"blur"}`
3. `command_run {id:"filter.blur.gaussian", params:{radius:4}}`
4. `doc_render_preview` to check the result
5. `doc_save {path:"out.pcraft"}`

## Testing strategy

- **Unit and property tests** in every crate. proptest is used for tile COW, regions and codecs.
- **Format crates:**
  - synthetic generators (`psd::testgen`)
  - byte-exact round trips
  - malformed-input sweeps (truncate at every offset)
  - fuzz targets (`crates/*/fuzz`)
- **Real-file corpus** in `corpus/` (gitignored). `corpus/psd` holds MIT-licensed test PSDs, listed with their sources in `corpus/psd/SOURCES.md`, and `cargo xtask corpus --download` fetches PngSuite. Tests skip silently when a corpus is absent.
- **Composite oracle:** a PSD's embedded merged image is compared with our compositor's output. The pass rate is tracked in the roadmap.
- **UI:** unit tests for widgets and state, plus screenshot checks through the control channel.

## Performance notes

- The canvas is presented by a custom WGSL shader (`ui-egui/src/gpu_canvas.rs`): mip-mapped/nearest sampling, procedural checkerboard, pixel grid, tiling. Brush strokes upload only their damage rect.
- **Compositing is still CPU** (`photocraft-compose`). Live adjustment previews on large documents use a downsampled proxy (`ui-egui/src/proxy.rs`). The GPU compositor is milestone M5.
- `ui.inspect` returns `perf` timings (UI ms per frame, composite ms, upload ms).
- Never scan full surfaces per frame. Cache per document revision (`PhotocraftApp::cached_bounds`). An uncached `content_bounds()` on a 36 MP layer once cost 77 ms per frame.

## Web build

`apps/photocraft-web` runs the same `PhotocraftApp` in the browser through eframe's web runner. The renderer is wgpu: WebGPU where the browser has it, WebGL2 otherwise. It is Rust only. The only JavaScript is the glue that wasm-bindgen generates.

```sh
brew install trunk                 # or: cargo install trunk --locked
cd apps/photocraft-web
trunk build --release              # writes ../../dist/web (index.html, .js glue, .wasm)
trunk serve --release              # dev server on http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

Any static file server works for `dist/web`, for example `python3 -m http.server 8765` run inside that directory. Trunk downloads the matching `wasm-bindgen` and `wasm-opt` itself. The release `.wasm` is about 12.7 MB, or 5.0 MB gzipped. Serve it with compression.

URL flags: `?webgl` forces the WebGL2 backend, and `?cpu` forces the CPU canvas path.

How the web shell (`apps/photocraft-web/src/web.rs`) differs from desktop:

- **Open** uses `rfd::AsyncFileDialog`. The bytes arrive asynchronously in `Services::inbox`, which the app drains every frame.
- **Save / Save As / Export** trigger a browser download of the encoded bytes. The shell does this with a Blob, an object URL and a temporary `<a download>`, all created from Rust. There is no save dialog, so the suggested name becomes the download name.
- **Drag-and-drop:** `WebShell` takes the frame's `dropped_files` before the app sees them. It reads each file with `DroppedFile::bytes_async` and pushes the bytes into the inbox.
- **No control server:** browsers can't listen on TCP. To automate the web build, drive headless Chrome with `--remote-debugging-port`. `Page.setInterceptFileChooserDialog` plus `DOM.setFileInputFiles` covers Open, `Input.dispatchDragEvent` with `files` covers drops, and `Browser.setDownloadBehavior` captures downloads.
- Headless Chrome on macOS (`--headless=new --enable-unsafe-webgpu`) gets a real WebGPU adapter.


## Offscreen UI snapshots (no window)

Render the full UI headlessly with the real wgpu canvas, e.g. for design reviews or when the app
window would be occluded (macOS doesn't render occluded windows, so live `ui.screenshot` must raise
the window and steal focus):

```sh
cargo run --release -p photocraft-ui-egui --example snapshot -- \
    --out ui.png --size 1440x900 --scale 2 --open photo.jpg \
    --script '[["ui.set", {"tool": "type"}], ["ui.menu.invoke", {"id": "image.canvasSize"}]]'
```

`--script` is a list of control-protocol calls (`[method, params]`), applied in order.
Input calls (`ui.key`, `ui.type`, `ui.click`) now reply only after the app has processed the events,
so a following `ui.inspect` observes their effect.
